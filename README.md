# GifTastic

When the user clicks on a button, the page should grab 10 static, non-animated gif images from the GIPHY API and place them on the page.
When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif should animate. If the user clicks the gif again, it should stop playing.

Under every gif, display its rating (PG, G, so on).
Here we have made all the display gifs to be PG.

This data is provided by the GIPHY API.
Only once you get images displaying with button presses should you move on to the next step.

Add a food or any topic to out input box, then create a new button. By selecting the button, you will have 10 new gifs rendered to you and for your enjoyment! Have fun with my GifTatsic webpage.
